===================

You don't have to accept the default look and feel. You can add references to [BootSwatch](https://bootswatch.com/) 
from *Administration > Settings > Theme Options* to get about 16 different 
variations. 

Here's an example of using *superhero*:

 **Customer Header Content**:
```html
<!-- 
    cerulean, cosmo, cyborg, flatly, journal, readable, darkly, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, slate, spacelab, superhero, united, yeti 
-->
<link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/3.3.5/superhero/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```
